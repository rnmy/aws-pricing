# ASW Pricing Algorithm

A Second Wear (ASW) is a project initiated by a group of NUS students to help reduce textile waste in Singapore. 
<p> This simple <b> pricing algorithm </b> is used to determine the price of the clothing items <i>donated</i> to us, based on the <b>current conditions</b> of the individual items. 
There is a base price for each type of item and if there is any defect, the price would be reduced. A csv file with all the current conditions would be read and 2 csv files would 
be generated: 1 is for the buying prices and 1 is for the selling prices. </p>
